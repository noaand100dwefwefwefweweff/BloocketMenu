# BloocketMenu
Blooket hacks for cool people

To use!

To use the menu you simply go the the file called menu then you copy the code after that you just go into the blooket game and press down ctrl + shift + j which will open up the console then you just paste in the code that you copied then ur done!

Commands!

E = to open or hide the cheat menu you simply press e 

F = When you press f the auto answer will be applied so you dont have to open the menu infront of the teacher and turn it off for example

P = Panic button, This will completely shut down the cheat and make it unusable even if you press e one billion times. Good if someone rats you out and the teacher comes up to you.

More commands coming!
